I made this game in cs and I wanted to have this game in a GUI but they forced me to use a CLI so I'm stuck with this one. 

It's based on the classic childhood Hangman game where the goal is to simply find the missing letters/words that make up the final word/words. If the guessed letter exits in the final word, then all the places in the answer where that letter appers is revealed. You keep entering letters until the final word has been guessed. However, every time a guessed letter is incorrect then you use a life and the hangman starts to appear and build itself. Basically you need to guess the correct letters to get to the correct final word before the hangman dies.

In the code I only have one word for the user to guess. Feel free to add more words. The longer the words the better.
